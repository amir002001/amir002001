This Wednesday was my first in-person orientation throughout my three co-op
terms at TD. Looking back at it, I actually cannot fathom how far I have come.
The daunting first day, the constant confusion, and the shift in my career path
all seem silly now. I am thankful to those who have mentored me. If you are
reading this Kavin, Josh, and Tom, bless you. It has been an immense honour to
work with you. Kavin, you have taught me the importance of productivity and
doing work with passion. Josh, you have taught me that there is always work for
those who ask for it and have shown me how to answer silly questions politely.
Finally, Tom, you have taught me Linux to an extent I could not imagine learning
until my senior days, possibly the most valuable of all.

It brings a smile to my face to see new interns. I get ready for the fall wind
and prepare myself to treat them with the respect you treated me with.
