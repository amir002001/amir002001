Excuse the low-res photo, but it was too valuable for me to not put it here.
Hack the North 2023 was one of the most memorable hackathons I've attended
throughout the years.

Galaxia, if you're reading this, I have no idea how to thank you for asking me
to do a workshop with you. It felt like a dream to see our workshop come to
life, and to see so many hackers attend, ask questions, and use our advice.
Thank you for being the realest friend, and giving my life colour in its grayest
moments.

Eric, I felt a pang in my heart when I found out you live in BC. I rarely find
meaning in the connections I make in events these days. I am tired of starting
conversations with a trap laid on either side. I came into Hack the North
wanting to make real friends and, as much as I can, avoid making LinkedIn
connections. When I started talking to you Eric, I just knew I'd met a lifelong
friend. From the bottom of my heart I want us to meet again and play our fun
board games. To Shernan, thanks for being prepared for everything quite
literally. I loved the 50-piece Mr. Puffs, and wish I ate more.
