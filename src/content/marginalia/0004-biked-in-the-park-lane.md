Riding on my bike,

selfish and self-centered,

my heart came to a stop.

my fear was rendered.

I slowed down slightly,

and went to the bike lane.

For I had seen the man,

the law which is my bane.

Luckily for me,

he was not around,

he just left his car,

on that holy ground.

I dodged him again,

one of many times.

Contempt with myself,

committer of heinous crimes.

overrun with shame,

I pedal with disdain.

I have done it again

I biked in the park lane
