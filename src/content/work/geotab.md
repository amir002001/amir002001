shortDescription: How we took a machine-learning-powered city twin for Kingston using computer vision from cameras deployed onto city transit from concept to reality. This was my introduction to GIS, mapping, and vehicular vision.

What started as a POC project, has now become one of the projects that I'm most proud of. A group of 2 other engineers, a product manager, and I were assigned the task of creating a city twin of Kingston with visualizations of video data from model-equipped cameras deployed to city buses. The project is now in production, being used by the city and maintained by GEOTAB.

We weren't bound by anything besides our imagination, so we used the latest technology and tried to create a robust application.

## 💼 Responsibilities and Projects 💼

I was responsible for creating the frontend of our city twin coupled with the API routes necessary to fetch data. This consisted of a MapBoxGL application that used several different layers from data sources such as OSM (Open Street Maps), ODK (Open Data Kingston), and data gathered by the camera in the forms of pedestrian heatmaps, vehicle trips lines, jaywalking heatmaps, toppled bins, and more.

One of the most fun parts of this internship had to be using BigQuery's geospatial queries. I couldn't believe that you could query a polygon inside a database!

## 📚 Lessons Learned 📚

Our field is incredibly unique as it has the ability to solve problems in any industry. Most problems could be solved better using computers and machine learning.

I also learned how important visualizations are. It doesn't matter how good your data is, if it's not presentable, nobody cares or bats an eye.

## 🏆 Achievements and Contributions 🏆

Working with a massive amount of data led to a lot of tough problems we faced while querying them. This made us think about the importance of our indexes, the shape of the data, caching, and our query layer.

## 🔮 Core Memory 🔮

Having our first meeting with the city council was unreal. We showed up in suits and presented what we had prepared, and they loved it. They weren't technical people, but they were fascinated and eager to hear the details of hearing how everything works. It was going to be Christmas soon, and it was an unforgettable sensation on the train back looking at the falling snow thinking of what we'd accomplished.
