an old-school sysadmin and I worked on a legacy Angular.JS and Grails internal streaming app for students' capstone projects. While we did rewrite part of the app, most of the work involved tweaking and fine-tuning the existing system to fit our needs. It was amazing to see it come to life and witness students come in and use it. It was one of the first experiences where I saw actual users picking up a product I shipped. At the time I was working on this project, I remember being a bit pissed that we were strictly working with on-premise solutions, but thinking back at it now, I miss the feeling of going into that cold server room.

## 💼 Responsibilities and Projects 💼

I was responsible for the project as a whole, with my coworker basically being my product manager and mentor. He would give me feedback on my work and unblock me when I was stuck.

The main responsibilities consisted of migrating the old schema to fit our use-case needs, moving off the deprecated Angular.JS frontend, creating an engaging experience, and deploying it all into production.

## 📚 Lessons Learned 📚

We have created some amazing abstractions over technology. So amazing, that it is possible to use these abstractions for a long time without knowing the underlying complexity. Yet, I realized how important it is to understand what is happening under the hood. It's important to know how my files are served, my database is managed, and my server is maintained. Not only does this give me a better grasp of the entire picture, one day, when the abstractions fail, I'll be the one who has at least a clue on how to fix them.

Another lesson I have to carry away is from my mentor and coworker. At the time I was pushing heavily to just completely move off to a new solution. He told me a rewrite is always the easiest way, but maintaining is what showcases someone's abilities to tackle hard problems. I remember it to this day and make sure to always try my best to work with what's already there and improve upon that instead of tearing everything up and trying again.

## 🏆 Achievements and Contributions 🏆

We managed to move off of the legacy Angular.JS code and shift to Svelte, connecting it to the previous Grails backend. I also implemented a TikTok-style infinite scroll using a pagination API I implemented into the Grails backend.

Another thing we worked on was a Matomo self-hosted analytics service that would give students insights into post interactions, bounce rates, etc.

## 🔮 Core Memory 🔮

I helped my coworker set up a brand-new server rack. It felt like piecing a Lego together. Something about watching it come online and connect to the grid felt magical.
