title: Sheridan FAAD
role: Software Engineer Intern
shortDescription: Worked with an old-school sys admin on a legacy Angular.JS and Grails video streaming app. I realized the importance of mastering my tools, as my IDE comfort was not always guaranteed. While we did rewrite part of the app, most of the work involved tweaking and fine-tuning the existing system to fit our needs.

ThinkResearch was the first and one of the most impactful internships of my CS career. During my time at ThinkResearch, I was thrown at a daunting React codebase with barely any knowledge of the framework and had to learn an immense amount of knowledge over a short period.

## 💼 Responsibilities and Projects 💼

During my internship term, I was part of a big initiative to move off of the React Native codebase and fully dedicate to a Progressive Web Application (PWA). The codebase was massive and it used Redux as an application state manager.

This brings us to the other initiative of trying to decouple the server state from the client state by moving most of the state logic to the backend, allowing it to be fetched via the GraphQL API consumed by Apollo.

My main task was writing the micro-frontend involving the calling/chat feature between the patient and the doctor, which used AWS Chime as the framework.

## 📚 Lessons Learned 📚

This was one of the many, but much-needed times where my ego was shattered. I thought I knew so much, yet it turned out I knew so little. This feeling of inadequacy sent me into a frenzy of self-improvement.

ThinkResearch was my first exposure to an approach I have been trying to perfect in every new and daunting challenge I take on, that being the approach of learning fast in a short period. I started following React content creators on YouTube, Twitter, and Medium. I would listen to the Syntax FM podcast by WesBos daily, and I caught up with tons of blog content written by legends such as Dan Abramov, Kent C. Odds, TKDodo, etc., taking notes and trying to make side projects with what I learned.

Another aspect of myself that I noticed at ThinkResearch was that I overthink asking questions. This was at the peak of the pandemic as well, and I blame it on my lack of social skills on communication platforms like Slack and Teams at the time, but I was so afraid of asking my seniors and leads questions. I won't forget the time my lead scheduled a one-on-one with me to ensure that internships are two-way streets. I am there to get the job done, and they are there to show me how to get there.

## 🏆 Achievements and Contributions 🏆

By the end of the term, the call/chat feature was written, unit-tested, and integrated with AWS Chime. It was a little hard to unit-test interactions with Chime using playtesting, but we managed to find ways around it. I helped migrate off the Redux store and learned quite about GraphQL quirks. I am thankful for the amazing people at ThinkResearch and will try my best to apply the knowledge they taught me throughout my career.

## 🔮 Core Memory 🔮

I'm trying to write about a core memory for each position I've had. The most memorable one at ThinkResearch has to be when I forgot to mute myself and burped the loudest possible chunk of air I've ever exhaled in my whole life followed by a solid 5 seconds of silence and laughter by the entire team. I will never recover from this...
