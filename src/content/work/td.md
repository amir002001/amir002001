I got my offer as a SWE intern at TD. Little did I know, I was going to be placed on the platform engineering team. I got placed in a team where I had to learn fast. I dedicated a lot of my hours on weekends and after work learning about the cloud-native landscape, tooling, and patterns. It was stressful, but only possible due to being placed in a team of highly motivated individuals.

## 💼 Responsibilities and Projects 💼

I would usually get assigned two epics per quarter to work on, but I would constantly talk to other teammates about what they were working on and peer programmed and shadowed them when they were blocked to learn more.

I was also on-call twice a quarter and had to use run books every once in a while to fix outages and solve bugs.

Some of the projects I'm proud of would be the introduction of scalable GitHub runners deployed in AKS for use across the bank, revolutionizing the iOS build pipeline by introducing Bazel and AWS EC2 M1 instances, and also creating the TD Marketplace for promoting inner-source across departments

## 📚 Lessons Learned 📚

One of the hardest things for me to get over was imposter syndrome, especially during my first work term at TD. My team was mostly senior engineers and they all had graduate degrees from prestigious schools and worked at prestigious companies beforehand. I learned how to use this as a method of reminding myself that there is so much more to learn, and as I learned more and more, I noticed the gap shrinking, and my hunger for learning increasing.

Another new aspect of platform engineering is that your customers are developers. Contrary to other customers, developers have very different expectations for what a good product, and are much better at spotting defects in a product. It was stressful yet refreshing to work with people who understood your product and criticized it so heavily.

I also learned the importance of having a second brain and documenting everything. After a while, I realized repeating patterns in outages, problems, and bugs, and by taking notes and jotting down great docs, I knew more and more and how to solve our domain-specific problems. This skill has been invaluable to my success as TD and as an engineer.

## 🏆 Achievements and Contributions 🏆

I shipped several key KPIs and monitoring scrapers to be used by KPI teams. I started to work on the TD Marketplace as a side project and demoed it to my manager, which got turned into a deliverable for quarter 3.
My lead and I also worked on creating a scalable GitHub runner service that is capable of running Docker in Docker for complex workflows.

## 🔮 Core Memory 🔮

I guess this has been a recurring core memory, but at the start of every quarter, I'd get to meet everyone on the team across Canada, the US, and the UK all at our office for PI planning week. We would go out to the Loose Moose after work for food and conversation, and it'd feel really magical chatting with some of the folks you only talk to on WebEx in person.
