Something that is missing is the presence of a polished, and aesthetically pleasing application that will display COVID-19 information which can be catered to the average user. Our application helps solves this problem as it gives users quick access to vital COVID-19 information without too many obstacles in the quest for information.

The application displays the COVID-19 status and information related to the status in a nice interface and is intuitive to use. Users can interact with a map that contains the different Public Health Units in Ontario, Canada and tap on any region to see the most recent COVID-19 status. They can choose to save this information, share it to other apps or favourite it and view it later in a dedicated favourites page.

# How We Built It

This application is built using React Native CLI and JavaScript with the use of various React Native packages from the community.
