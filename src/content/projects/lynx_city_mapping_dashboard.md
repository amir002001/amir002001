Lynx specializes in processing dashcam footage using advanced machine learning models. With their innovative solution, Lynx adds predicted data to a map-based web application, providing valuable insights and analysis of road conditions and traffic flow. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, Lynx helps organizations make informed decisions and improve their operations, leading to a safer and more efficient transportation industry.

## Dashcam Footage Processing

Lynx's primary objective is to utilize processed dashcam footage to detect various elements such as pedestrians jaywalking, potholes, and toppled trashcans. However, the use cases of their solution extend beyond these examples, making it a versatile tool for analyzing road conditions and traffic patterns.

To achieve this, Lynx employs the Ultralytics Yolov5 Machine Learning project, a powerful and widely adopted machine learning model. Additionally, they leverage technologies like YOLOv5 and Carla, along with NVIDIA drive sim, to generate synthetic data and refine it through intelligent filtering techniques. This approach allows Lynx to create a more accurate representation of real-world scenarios, particularly tailored to the city of Kingston.

## Lynx City Mapping Dashboard

At the heart of Lynx's solution is the Lynx City Mapping Dashboard, a map-based web application designed to provide comprehensive insights and analysis of road conditions and traffic flow. This interactive and highly customizable web browser environment displays Geojson data using MAPBOX, powered by vector tiles and WebGL.

Key Features of the Lynx City Mapping Dashboard:

1.  Polygon-Based Video Search: Users can draw polygons on the map to identify and retrieve videos located within specific areas of interest. This feature allows for targeted analysis of road anomalies like potholes, pedestrian activity, and other relevant factors.

2.  Real-Time Data Visualization: The dashboard provides real-time visualizations of road conditions, traffic flow, and detected objects. Users can gain immediate insights into the current state of the transportation network, enabling them to make informed decisions promptly.

3.  Customization and Scalability: Lynx understands the unique requirements of different organizations. The City Mapping Dashboard offers extensive customization options, allowing users to tailor the visual representation and analysis to their specific needs. Additionally, the platform is scalable, accommodating datasets of various sizes.

## Driving Informed Decisions and Operational Improvements

By utilizing Lynx's solution, organizations can make informed decisions and improve their operations in the transportation industry. The insights provided by the dashcam footage processing and Lynx City Mapping Dashboard enable the following benefits:

1.  Enhanced Safety Measures: Identifying hazardous conditions, such as jaywalking pedestrians and potholes, allows organizations to take proactive measures to address them promptly. This leads to increased safety for both drivers and pedestrians.

2.  Optimized Traffic Flow: By analyzing traffic patterns and congestion areas, organizations can identify opportunities for optimizing traffic flow. This can lead to reduced travel times, decreased fuel consumption, and improved overall efficiency.

3.  Road Infrastructure Maintenance: Detecting road anomalies, such as potholes and toppled trashcans, facilitates proactive road infrastructure maintenance. Organizations can prioritize repairs and allocate resources effectively, reducing the risk of accidents and ensuring a smooth driving experience.
