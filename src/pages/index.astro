    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there, I'm currently an Engineer at TD Bank, working on the future of
      the bank's internal developer platform. Some of the interesting projects
      I've worked on during my time here include scalable AKS runners, setting
      up and managing an HA Patroni Postgres for Terraform and Nexus, and
      setting up a Bazel build pipeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that, I was an engineer at GEOTAB where we worked on our city twin
      application to use computer vision to detect anomalies in the streets of
      Kingston.
    </p>
