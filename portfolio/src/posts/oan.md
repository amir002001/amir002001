title: "Efficient Inference Using Objectness Activation Networks"
---

Aerial imagery has grown to sizes and resolutions beyond comprehension.
For Detroit alone, Maxar satellite imagery is around 50 GB with
aerial imagery being around 100 GB.

Inference for this scale of imagery is expensive, but paired with and
Objectness Activation Network (OAN), a much cheaper threshold can be
calculated to determine whether a tile has features.
